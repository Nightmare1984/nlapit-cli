### What it is

This toolkit aims to be an all-in-one solution for post-installation, expediting your Arch setup. It's offered as *use at your own risk* type of thing, without much support. You will have to rely on yourself and your own knowledge and ability to do research your setup. For more detailed info visit the [**Wiki**](https://wiki.xerolinux.xyz/xlapit/).

### How to get it

First off let me say that everything this awesome toolkit provides is and will forever be optional and up to you the user. I will never force anything on you.

**- Check the code 1st :**

> For security, don't just run script, without inspecting it first. So before using _Curl_ command you can examine it => [**HERE**](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xerolinux/xerocurl/main/xapi.sh)

Now, once you have inspected the code, just run this simple curl command to get started :

```
bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://tinyurl.com/xtoolkit)"
```

It will prompt you before injecting as in adding the XeroLinux repository, where from it will then prompt you, should you agree, as to which AUR helper you prefer, then proceed to do so then install and launch the toolkit.. Again only if you agree..

### Acessing Toolkit

You can access toolkit by either typing `xero-cli -m` in terminal or from the application menu via the **XeroLinux Post Installation Toolkit** shortcut.. Just close terminal window once done using it lol ;)

### How to Contribute

If you can/want to Contribute your knowledge improving this toolkit taking it above and beyond, making it the defacto for every **Arch** user, please see [**Here**](https://github.com/xerolinux/xlapit-cli/wiki/User-Contribution) for more information.
